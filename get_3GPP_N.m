function N = get_3GPP_N(K,E,n_max)
% GET_3GPP_N Obtain the number of bits in the input and output of the polar
% encoder kernal, according to Section 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 38.212
%   N = GET_3GPP_N(K,E,n_max) obtains the number of bits in the input and
%   output of the polar encoder kernal N.
%
%   K should be an integer scalar. It specifies the number of bits in the
%   information and CRC bit sequence.
%
%   E should be an integer scalar. It specifies the number of bits in the
%   encoded bit sequence.
%
%   n_max should be an integer scalar. It specifies the log2 of the maximum
%   number of bits in the input and output of the polar encoder kernal.
%   n_max = 9 in the PBCH and PDCCH channels, while n_max = 10 in the PUCCH
%   channel.
